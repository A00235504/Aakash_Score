# Aakash_Score
Basic Score keeping App.

**About**
This is a simple score keeping Application where a user can keep track of score. The App has three scoring systems of one point, two points and three points.
Depending on what team scores you can select the team using the team selector switch, the highlighted text is the selected team for getting the score updated.
The App theme color is purple and the highlighted text is purple. There is + and - buttons to increase or decrease the score. 
Also a reset button is provided to reset the score with one click.

Hope this app solves the problem of keeing up with scores and you can enjoy the game also.
